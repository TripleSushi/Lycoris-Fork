# Deepwoken Rewrite
**No modules were updated.**

**No timings were updated.**

**Any new features?**
```diff
- (bug fix) Manually managed notifications now use the scaled notification size
+ (changed) Timing probabilities list is now alphabetically sorted
+ (changed) Auto parry now respects AP frames (please report any issues with this, I remember some on Legacy; it should say it detected AP frames in notifications)
+ (added) Auto mantra followup
```

*If you're wondering on what to use or where to buy from...*
